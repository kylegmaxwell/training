Sample code, interview prep, and training.

This project contains a basic custom Unit test framework that is used by main.cpp to run all the different test programs.

Pleae start by looking at the N Queens example. This is a solution for how to place
N Queens on a chessboard such that they do not threaten each other.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
The code for that is available in source/queens.cpp.
Sample output from the code is in queens_sample_output.txt.

You can also look at other unit tests, which are implementations of problems from the
Elements of Programming Interviews book, but they are not yet as polished.
