# training
Sample code, interview prep, and training.

This project contains a basic custom Unit test framework that is used by main.cpp to run all the different test programs.

Pleae start by looking at the N Queens example. This is a solution for how to place
N Queens on a chessboard such that they do not threaten each other.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
The code for that is available in training/InterviewPrep/queens and includes two classes and a text file containing some sample output from the code.

You can also look at other unit tests, which are implementations of problems from the
Elements of Programming Interviews book, but they are not yet as polished.
